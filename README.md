Good day.

This is the readme file.  If you are reading this, good job, you followed the instruction provided in the title of this document.
Continue to follow all of my instructions, and you will be rewarded.  Disobey my instructions, and you will be swiftly destroyed.. or at least your change requests will be destroyed.

Rule #1
Stay Organized
o Make clear, understandable comments for everything
o Communicate what you are doing, why you are doing it, and when it will be done
o Keep it all squeaky clean.
o Develop, and follow the roadmap as closely as possible.  There will obviously be deviations, but the closer we stick to the plan, the better the outcome.

Rule #2
Test, Test, Test
o If you make a change, no matter how small, test.
o Test everything you think your change will affect.
o Test everything you think your change will NOT affect.  Just to be sure.
o Test to break the game, not to see if it will work.

Rule #3
Stay Positive
o This will probably make you want to rip your hair out.  Don't.
o Roll with the punches, and punch back even harder.
o If you get excessively stuck, take a break to think things over, ask for help, or even work on something else for a bit.

Rule #4
Do What Is Agreed Upon, Until We Agree To Do Something Different
o If you have a new idea, I ABSOLUTELY want to hear it.
o Remember that, for the sake of time, even good ideas may get pushed, or even left behind.

Rule #5
Push to Publish
o The sooner we get this game completed to the minimum viable level, we want to launch.
o This will put us in the position to make money sooner rather than later, and increase in that profit over time based on my planned cost structure.

Rule #6
Have Fun
o Yes this is cheesy, but we are doing something that most people only dream of.  Fuck the dreamers, we take action.
o Caveat: I don't expect this to be fun 100% of the time, it's going to be a lot of work.  I only expect you to remember that this is a game.
