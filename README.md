Good day.<br>
<br>
This is the readme file.  If you are reading this, good job, you followed the instruction provided in the title of this document.<br>
Continue to follow all of my instructions, and you will be rewarded.  Disobey my instructions, and you will be swiftly destroyed.. or at least your change requests will be destroyed.<br>
<br>
<strong>Rule #1</strong><br>
<strong>Stay Organized</strong><br>
o Make clear, understandable comments for everything<br>
o Communicate what you are doing, why you are doing it, and when it will be done<br>
o Keep it all squeaky clean.<br>
o Develop, and follow the roadmap as closely as possible.  There will obviously be deviations, but the closer we stick to the plan, the better the outcome.<br>
<br>
<strong>Rule #2</strong><br>
<strong>Test, Test, Test</strong><br>
o If you make a change, no matter how small, test.<br>
o Test everything you think your change will affect.<br>
o Test everything you think your change will NOT affect.  Just to be sure.<br>
o Test to break the game, not to see if it will work.<br>
<br>
<strong>Rule #3</strong><br>
<strong>Stay Positive</strong><br>
o This will probably make you want to rip your hair out.  Don't.<br>
o Roll with the punches, and punch back even harder.<br>
o If you get excessively stuck, take a break to think things over, ask for help, or even work on something else for a bit.<br>
<br>
<strong>Rule #4</strong><br>
<strong>Do What Is Agreed Upon, Until We Agree To Do Something Different</strong><br>
o If you have a new idea, I ABSOLUTELY want to hear it.<br>
o Remember that, for the sake of time, even good ideas may get pushed, or even left behind.<br>
<br>
<strong>Rule #5</strong><br>
<strong>Push to Publish</strong><br>
o The sooner we get this game completed to the minimum viable level, we want to launch.<br>
o This will put us in the position to make money sooner rather than later, and increase in that profit over time based on my planned cost structure.<br>
<br>
<strong>Rule #6</strong><br>
<strong>Have Fun</strong><br>
o Yes this is cheesy, but we are doing something that most people only dream of.  Fuck the dreamers, we take action.<br>
o Caveat: I don't expect this to be fun 100% of the time, it's going to be a lot of work.  I only expect you to remember that this is a game.<br>
