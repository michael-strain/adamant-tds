EXAMPLE LEVEL DESCRIPTION

You awake to find yourself in a room.  The walls are white, the ceiling is white, and you see no doors.  There are no light sources, it's as if the walls themselves are emitting a white light, and it is as bright as a cloudless day.

The players will not escape.  This is a room to invite chaos.  When they realize that there is no escape, they will begin to kill each other.
